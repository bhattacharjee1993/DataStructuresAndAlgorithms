This is an IntelliJ CommandLine Project.
Ideal Steps to access the project:
- Download IntelliJ CommunityEdition if you already don't have. Link: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=mac&code=IIC
- Open the root Folder in IntelliJ i.e. `DSAlgo`
- And you could then see the folder structure.
- Since this is a command line project, you could find the `Main.java` and you could simply call a class from inside the `main()` method to execute it.

Happy Coding :)
